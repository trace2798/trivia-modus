      'Modus is an open source, serverless framework for building functions and APIs, powered by WebAssembly.You write your app logic in Go or AssemblyScript, and Modus provides additional features to easily integrate models, data, and external services.To build apps that are thoughtful, fun, and effective, we often need to integrate models in different forms, whether generative large language models or classical machine/deep learning models.Your app might be a simple create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) function that has a single model to identify similar entries. Or, it could be a complex agentic reasoning system that chains dozens of models and data sources together. Modus creates a way of working with models that scales with your needs.Modus exists to make it easier for you to build the apps of your dreams.',
